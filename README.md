Employee Salary Prediction, using ML models
AICTE ID : STU681e18156eaa81746802709

#Problem Statement
In today's data-driven business environment, companies need to collect vast information about employees â€” such as age, education, occupation, and work experience. However, manually analyzing these features to predict salary class is error-prone, time-consuming, and inconsistent.
To solve this issue the goal is to develop a machine learning-based system that accurately predicts whether an employee earns above or below $50K based on key demographic and work-related features.

#Algorithm and Deployment
1.Data Collection: 
Used the Adult Income dataset
2.Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values
Applied Label Encoding to categorical columns
Feature scaling using StandardScaler
3.Model Training:
Trained multiple models:
Logistic Regression
SVM
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
4.Model Evaluation:
Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for comparison
5.Best Model Selection & Saving:
Chose the best-performing model
Saved using joblib or .h5 format
6.Deployment
Created a user-friendly UI using Streamlit
Deployed on Google Colab using Ngrok 

#System Approach
Hardware:
     i) Processor:AMD Ryzen 7 5800H with Radeon Graphics
     ii)RAM:16.00 GB  
Language: Python
IDE: Google Colab
